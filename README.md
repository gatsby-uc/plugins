# Welcome to the Gatsby User Collective!

The Gatsby UC was born out of a desire to create higher quality plugins in the Gatsby ecosystem by reducing maintainer work loads.

## What aspire to be

Most Gatsby plugin projects aren't massive. Sometimes they need regular maintenance, a lot of the time they do not. Either way, original authors become unable or willing to maintain a plugin at any given moment or maybe indefinately. This is not a condemnation, it's a fact of life that sometimes maintainers need to move on. No matter the cause, this results in plugins going un-maintained by their authors. Others are willing and able to help; but with no active maintainer means they're unable to. At times this means fixing bugs in less ideal ways, creating duplicate implementations of plugins, etc. The Gatsby User collective's goal is to democratize the maintenance of these plugins to allow more folks to assist in their maintenance.

## Where we are at

The details of this community is still being flushed out. As problems arrive we will solve them together and in an open fashion. For now check out

## What we are not

- **Free labor**: We exist to allow more people to do the work of maintaining Open Source software. We hope to enable you to solve your own problems and in doing so, help others. If you are unable to do the work we still welcome bug reports and feature requests. What we will not tolerate is entitlement expecting others to do that work on your timeline. If you'd like to sponsor (read: pay someone) to solve a specific problem we very much are open to that and please let the community know.

- **Support**: Support is an aspect of maintaining open source. The point of this Collective is to take the burden of maintenance off any one person. The hope is that results in better maintenance (incl. support), but it's not a guarantee. Folks around here will help as they can; if it's urgent to you, try breaking out your wallet. ðŸ˜Š
