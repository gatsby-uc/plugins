# Old Repo Issue Response

When archiving a repo that's been transfered to the GUC issues that could still be implemented need to be responded to if not transfered to the GUC issues. Here is the recomended response:

```markdown
Thanks for your interest in this project. This plugin is moving into the [Gatsby User Collective](https://github.com/gatsby-uc/plugins) and this repo will be archived. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/gatsby-uc/plugins/issues/new/choose) in that repository, submit a PR if you'd like to see this implemented, or join us on [Discord](discord.gg/gwnqfzetjv) if you have questions!
```
