The [Gatsby User Collective](https://github.com/gatsby-uc/plugins) has taken upon itself the task to maintain and release this plugin from now on.

  Changes made:

  - We've merged in https://github.com/gatsby-uc/gatsby-source-strapi/pull/289 allowing contentTypes from plugins to be fetched
  - We've added peerDependencies for Gatsby 5
  - The code has been altered to match GUC's prettier and linting rules

  Because of these changes, in ownership and in code, we've released this version as a major. It should not contain any breaking changes and upgrading should be possible without any issues.
