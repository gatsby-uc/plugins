# gatsby-plugin-pinterest

## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#351](https://github.com/gatsby-uc/plugins/pull/351) [`3029c4b`](https://github.com/gatsby-uc/plugins/commit/3029c4bd65bbc5bc5203c19bd93c392934518136) Thanks [@moonmeister](https://github.com/moonmeister)! - When plugins are nested inside a Gatsby Theme they are required to have an `index.js` file in the package root. We recently removed these not knowing this requirement. Files restored and tests added.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#318](https://github.com/gatsby-uc/plugins/pull/318) [`2c527dc`](https://github.com/gatsby-uc/plugins/commit/2c527dcc09bfc50b6db7612369ce44267cd8e11d) Thanks [@moonmeister](https://github.com/moonmeister)! - Moved into the Gatsby User Collective.
